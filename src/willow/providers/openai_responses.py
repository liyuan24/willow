"""OpenAI Responses API provider.

Translates Willow's normalized `CompletionRequest` / `CompletionResponse`
shape to and from the `openai` SDK's `responses.create` API.

Stateful chaining
-----------------
The Responses API is designed around server-side conversation state. This
provider uses it natively:

  * The first call sends the conversation as `input` items and `store=True`,
    causing the server to persist the response.
  * Subsequent calls pass `previous_response_id=<id>` and send only the
    *delta* — the messages newly appended by the loop since the last call.
    The server has all prior items in its chain, so prior turns (including
    reasoning items) are never resent.

State is per-instance and per-agent-run: ``willow.agent.run_agent``
constructs a fresh ``OpenAIResponsesProvider`` for each run, so the chain
naturally scopes to one conversation. There is no global state.

Cursor tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``_seen_messages_count`` is the index in ``request.messages`` past which
items still need to be delivered to the server. Building input from
``request.messages[_seen_messages_count:]`` therefore yields exactly the
delta. After a successful call we set
``_seen_messages_count = len(request.messages) + 1`` — the ``+1``
anticipates the loop appending one assistant message (the response we just
returned) before it builds the next ``CompletionRequest``. Whatever the loop
appends after that (typically a single user-tool-result message) is then
the only delta on the next call.

Reasoning items
---------------
Under chaining the server already has all prior reasoning items in its
chain, so the *outgoing* delta never needs to carry reasoning blocks. In
practice the delta only ever consists of `function_call_output` items
(plus, rarely, additional user input), neither of which carries reasoning
— so this falls out of the cursor logic for free. Reasoning items still
appear in *incoming* responses and are translated to ``ThinkingBlock``
entries so the loop's chat history is faithful; they end up at indices
strictly less than ``_seen_messages_count`` after the next call updates
the cursor, so they are naturally excluded from future deltas.

Translation choices that are not forced by the wire format:
  * `ToolResultBlock.is_error=True` becomes a prefix `"[error] "` on the
    `function_call_output.output` string. The Responses API has no
    `is_error` field on `function_call_output`, and the model only ever
    sees `output` as text — a deterministic textual marker is the only
    principled way to surface the failure flag to the next turn.

ThinkingBlock fields used in serialization (when the rare case arises that
a delta does include one — kept correct for completeness):
  * `ThinkingBlock.signature` carries the reasoning item's `id`. A block
    without an `id` cannot be replayed (the API requires one), so it is
    silently dropped on the way out.
  * `ThinkingBlock.encrypted_content`, when present, is replayed as the
    reasoning item's `encrypted_content` field.
  * On the way back, each `reasoning` output item becomes one `ThinkingBlock`
    with `thinking` set to the concatenated `summary_text` parts.

Reasoning knobs (`thinking` / `effort` / `budget`) -> `reasoning={"effort": ...}`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Responses API's reasoning knob is categorical (`reasoning={"effort":
...}`). When `request.thinking` is `False` no `reasoning` kwarg is emitted.
When `True`, the effort is resolved in this order:

  * `request.effort` set: passed through, with `"max"` clamped to `"xhigh"`.
  * else `request.budget` set: bucketed via:

        budget < 2048   -> "low"
        budget < 8192   -> "medium"
        budget < 32768  -> "high"
        otherwise       -> "xhigh"

  * else: no `reasoning` kwarg is emitted at all (API default applies).
