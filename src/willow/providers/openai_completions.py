"""OpenAI Chat Completions API provider.

Translates Willow's normalized `CompletionRequest` / `CompletionResponse`
shape to and from the `openai` SDK's `chat.completions.create` API.

The Chat Completions wire format is structurally different from Willow's
internal block-based shape in three ways, all handled here:

  * `system` is prepended as a `{"role": "system"}` wire message rather than
    a top-level parameter.
  * Assistant turns split text and tool calls across the parallel
    `content` / `tool_calls` fields; we collapse our ordered block list
    onto that pair.
  * Tool results live on a dedicated `"tool"` wire role; each
    `ToolResultBlock` in a Willow user message is lifted to its own wire
    message (one-to-many).

OpenAI's tool role has no `is_error` flag, so an error result is conveyed
by prepending a sentinel `"[error] "` prefix to the wire `content`. This
is documented and tested; the convention is deterministic and round-trip
visible to the model.

Stop-reason vocabulary is Anthropic's; OpenAI's `finish_reason` is mapped
into it (`stop` -> `end_turn`, `tool_calls` -> `tool_use`,
`length` -> `max_tokens`, anything else -> `stop_sequence`).

Reasoning is not preservable on this provider
---------------------------------------------
Chat Completions reasoning models do reason internally, but the API surface
exposes no content-block representation of that reasoning and no input
field that would let a client replay reasoning between turns. The only
reasoning-related signal returned is a token count
(`usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`).

Concretely: any `ThinkingBlock`s in `request.messages` are silently dropped
on the way out (they have no wire-format home), and the deserialized
response never contains a `ThinkingBlock`.

The provider does, however, support a `reasoning_effort` knob that
influences how much the model thinks internally. `request.thinking` plus
`request.effort` / `request.budget` now flow through to the wire as a
top-level `reasoning_effort` kwarg (with `effort="max"` clamped to
`"xhigh"` and a bare `budget` bucketed into an effort level). ThinkingBlocks
in inputs are still dropped (no wire representation); responses still
never contain ThinkingBlocks (no reasoning content channel).

This is a real limitation: a multi-turn agent run that depends on the
model carrying earlier reasoning forward through tool calls cannot use
this provider for reasoning continuity. Pick the Anthropic or OpenAI
Responses provider for reasoning-heavy tasks.
