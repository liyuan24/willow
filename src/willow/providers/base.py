"""Provider abstraction for Willow.

Three target APIs (Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses)
are normalized to one shape. The loop only ever speaks this shape; provider
plugins translate at the boundary in their `complete()` implementation.

Design notes:
  * Content blocks are explicit dataclasses, never untyped dicts. The
    Chat Completions style of "assistant.content + assistant.tool_calls as
    parallel fields" is flattened into a single ordered list of blocks per
    message — that is the lowest-common-denominator shape and matches both
    Anthropic and the Responses API natively.
  * Tool results live in a `Message(role="user", content=[ToolResultBlock, ...])`.
    This matches Anthropic exactly and is lifted to OpenAI's `tool` role
    messages by the OpenAI plugin (one `tool` message per ToolResultBlock).
  * `system` is a single string. Anthropic puts it in the top-level `system`
    parameter; OpenAI plugins prepend a `{"role": "system"}` message.
  * `tools` is a list of `Tool.spec()` dicts (`{name, description, input_schema}`),
    matching the existing `willow.tools.Tool` ABC. Provider plugins reshape into
    their own tool-declaration format.
  * `StopReason` is the Anthropic vocabulary; OpenAI plugins normalize their
    `finish_reason` into it (`stop` -> `end_turn`, `tool_calls` -> `tool_use`,
    `length` -> `max_tokens`).
  * `usage` is a free-form `dict[str, int]` of token counts. Recommended keys
    are `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and normalized `cached_tokens`, but
    providers may add their own cache-specific fields too.

        directly on its `thinking` blocks; the OpenAI Responses provider fills
        it from the concatenated `summary_text` parts of a reasoning item.
      * `signature` - the opaque round-trip key. For Anthropic this is the
        block's `signature` field (required to replay the block on the next
        request when extended thinking + tool use are combined). For OpenAI
        Responses this is the reasoning item's `id` (required to replay the
        item in `input` when running stateless with tool use).
      * `encrypted_content` - opaque ciphertext that some providers attach to
        a reasoning item (currently OpenAI Responses' `encrypted_content`).
        Modeled as a first-class optional field rather than smuggled inside
        `signature` so the round-trip is honest about what is being carried.

    A `signature` of `None` means the block is not round-trippable; provider
    plugins drop such blocks on the way out instead of producing an invalid

    Reasoning is configured by three independent knobs:

      * `thinking: bool` — master switch. `False` (default) requests no
        extended reasoning; `True` enables it.
      * `effort: Literal["low","medium","high","xhigh","max"] | None` —
        soft guidance on how much reasoning to do. `None` lets the provider
        use its default. `"max"` is Anthropic-only; OpenAI providers clamp
        it to `"xhigh"`.
      * `budget: int | None` — explicit reasoning-token budget. When set
        with `thinking=True`, runs in manual mode on Anthropic
        (`thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}`) and shadows
        `effort`. On OpenAI providers a budget without an explicit `effort`
        is bucketed into an effort level.

    Per-provider mapping when `thinking=True`:

      * Anthropic Messages:
          - `budget` set → `thinking={"type":"enabled","budget_tokens":N}`
            (manual mode; `effort` ignored).

            top-level `output_config={"effort": effort}`.
          - neither → `thinking={"type":"adaptive"}` (model picks default).
      * OpenAI Responses: emits `reasoning={...}`. `effort` is mapped
        (`"max"`→`"xhigh"`); a `budget` without `effort` is bucketed; with
        neither, the `effort` key is omitted (API default).
      * OpenAI Chat Completions: emits top-level `reasoning_effort=...`
        (mapped/bucketed the same way). The wire format has no
        reasoning-content channel, so ThinkingBlocks still cannot
        round-trip through this provider; only the effort knob takes effect.
